            As our final project for Markets and Social Systems on the Internet, I worked with Anna 
            Vazhaeparambil and Anna Zhou to determine if U.S. senators from the 117th Congress have a 
            greater likelihood of sharing a generation if they are members of the same sub-committee. 
        </p>
        <p className={styles.body}>
            To do this, we webscraped the Senate Committee Assignments page and an article about the 
            Senate on Wikipedia to gather information about which senators belong to which sub-committees 
            and what their respective seniority is.  
        </p>
        <p className={styles.body}>
            With this information, we then created a graph where the nodes are the senators and the edges 
            are constructed based on shared sub-committees. Then, we computed the average clustering coefficients 
            for each node of
        </p>
        <li>the complete graph</li>
        <li>an isolated graph where all the nodes share a common age</li>
        <li>an isolated graph where all the nodes have a distinct age</li>
        <p className={styles.body}>
            Although we didn't find any correlation between seniority and committee, we did discover that the 
            senate displays an incredibly skewed age distribution across committees, which can reveal the Senateâ€™s 
            disparate approach to addressing present-day issues.
